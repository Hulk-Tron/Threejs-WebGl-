Threejs and Webgl practice
THREEJS:

Three.js is cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a Web browser. Three.js uses WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.
WEBGL:

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas. WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group.
